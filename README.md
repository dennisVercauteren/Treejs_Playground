# Treejs Playground

This repository contains a simple three.js example with two intersecting tubes.

Because the example uses ES modules, most browsers block it when opened via the
`file://` scheme. Serve the files through a local web server and then navigate
to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` to view the scene:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
